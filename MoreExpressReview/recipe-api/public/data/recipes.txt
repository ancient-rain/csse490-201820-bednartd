		"1/4 cup capers",
		"1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, or more to taste",
		"3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano",
		"4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 3 pounds)",
		"1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste",
		"1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste",

    ],
    "directions": [
    	"1 Prep the tomato sauce: Pour the tomatoes into a bowl and crush with your hands or with a wooden spoon until you have uneven 1-inch pieces (you can also use scissors to snip the tomatoes into small pieces). Mix in the anchovies, olives, capers, red pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the oregano to the bowl. Set aside.",
		"2 Sear the chicken: Sprinkle the chicken all over with salt and black pepper. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until hot. Add the chicken and cook without disturbing for 3 minutes, or until browned. If you are using a cast-iron or stainless steel skillet, do not turn until the chicken moves easily without prodding. Turn and cook the other side for 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
		"3 Make the sauce: In the skillet over medium heat, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomato mixture â€“ be careful since the juices will splutter when you add them to the pan. Cook for 1 minute or until the spluttering stops. Stir well, turn down the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, black pepper, or red pepper, if you like.",
		"4 Add the chicken and finish the sauce: Add the chicken breasts and any juices to the skillet and spoon a little sauce over top. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 165F.",
		"5 Serve: Serve straight from the skillet or transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon oregano over the top and garnish with oregano sprigs. Serve with plenty of crusty bread."
